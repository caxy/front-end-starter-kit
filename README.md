## Features

* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
* [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
* [eslint](http://eslint.org)

## Requirements

* node `^4.5.0`
* yarn `^0.17.0`

## Getting Started

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/caxy/front-end-starter-kit.git <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

Then install dependencies and start it up! It is strongly recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of npm.

```bash
$ yarn install # Install project dependencies
$ yarn start   # Compile and launch (same as `npm start`)
```

If all is well, you should see something like this:

Open up [http://localhost:3000]() in your browser and you should see the starter kit welcome page!

## Console Commands

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`yarn run <script>`|Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Serves your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `yarn start`, but enables nodemon for the server as well.|
|`deploy`|Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.|
|`deploy:dev`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "development".|
|`deploy:prod`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "production".|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).|

## Application Structure

The application structure below is a starting point for the root project structure. This will be built upon as
standards are implemented for deeper directories.

*DEV: When proposing standards that affect the application structure, please update this tree.*

## Development

TODO: DOCUMENT DEVELOPER TOOLS AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT GENERIC THINGS

## Testing

TODO: DOCUMENT TESTING

## Deployment

The application may be served from the /dist directory generated by `yarn run deploy` and specifying your desired `NODE_ENV`.

## Build System

### Configuration

Default project configuration can be found in `~/config/project.config.js`. Here you'll be able to redefine your `src` and `dist` directories, adjust compilation settings, tweak your vendor dependencies, and more. For the most part, you should be able to make changes in here **without ever having to touch the actual webpack build configuration**.

If you need environment-specific overrides (useful for dynamically setting API endpoints, for example), you can edit `~/config/environments.config.js` and define overrides on a per-NODE_ENV basis. There are examples for both `development` and `production`, so use those as guidelines. Here are some common configuration options:

|Key|Description|
|---|-----------|
|`dir_src`|application source code base path|
|`dir_dist`|path to build compiled application to|
|`server_host`|hostname for the Express server|
|`server_port`|port for the Express server|
|`compiler_devtool`|what type of source-maps to generate (set to `false`/`null` to disable)|
|`compiler_vendor`|packages to separate into to the vendor bundle|

Webpack is configured to make use of [resolve.root](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-root), which lets you import local packages as if you were traversing from the root of your `~/src` directory. Here's an example:

```js
// current file: ~/src/views/some/nested/View.js
// What used to be this:
import SomeComponent from '../../../components/SomeComponent'

// Can now be this:
import SomeComponent from 'components/SomeComponent' // Hooray!
```

### Globals

These are global variables available to you anywhere in your source code. If you wish to modify them, they can be found as the `globals` key in `~/config/project.config.js`. When adding new globals, make sure you also add them to `~/.eslintrc`.

|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|`process.env.NODE_ENV`|the active `NODE_ENV` when the build started|
|`__DEV__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development`|
|`__PROD__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `production`|
|`__TEST__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `test`|

### Styles

Both `.scss` and `.css` file extensions are supported out of the box. After being imported, styles will be processed with [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for minification and autoprefixing, and will be extracted to a `.css` file during production builds.

### Server

This starter kit comes packaged with an Express server. It's important to note that the sole purpose of this server is to provide `webpack-dev-middleware` and `webpack-hot-middleware` for hot module replacement. Using a custom Express app in place of [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) makes it easier to extend the starter kit to include functionality such as API's, universal rendering, and more -- all without bloating the base boilerplate.

### Integrating a Framework

If you are integrating a framework like Angular or React, you should bootstrap that framework in `src/main.js`, which serves as the app's entry point. For example, if you are using React and your root component is `AppComponent`, you can modify the render function to mount your application like so:

```js
let render = () => {
  ReactDOM.render(<AppContainer />, MOUNT_NODE)
}
```

### Production Optimization

Babel is configured to use [babel-plugin-transform-runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-runtime) so transforms aren't inlined. In production, webpack will extract styles to a `.css` file, minify your JavaScript, and perform additional optimizations such as module deduplication.

## Learning Resources

- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - The Node.js server used for development.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/) - For modifying the webpack configuration, webpack's own documentation is indispensable.
